# Todo APP

###Introduction :
I made this application to practice redux toolkit and enhance my coding skills for more conditional rendering in Javascript. The page is responsive and the code is clean.

My main focus was to create a clean interface void of clutter.

I also added tooltips so as to give more information on hover.
